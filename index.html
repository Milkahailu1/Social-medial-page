            Although D’Amelio is a trained competitive dancer, her TikTok performances seem casual and unlabored. The New York City-based choreographer Grace Buckley, who has worked with D’Amelio in the past, said that the teenager “has always had a natural, self-assured sense of style while she’s dancing, which has translated very successfully to TikTok.” D’Amelio has refined the subtle components of TikTok dance performance: facial expressions, hand movements, timing, and flow.
